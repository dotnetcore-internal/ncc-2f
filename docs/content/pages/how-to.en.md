# How do guests participate in NCC Second Floor?

Thank you for your support of the *NCC Second Floor* program. The guests of *Second Floor* generally participate in the recording of live programs through two channels: 1. <u>invitation</u>, and 2. <u>self-recommendation</u>.

If you want to share your experience or insights with the audience/listeners through *Second Floor* and participate in our program, you can contact us through the following ways:

- Email,
- Leave a message in the WeChat Official Account or TheNCC's GitHub discussion, or,
- Contact any of NCC Directors, *Second Floor* producers or hosts, or any member of TheNCC PMC.

## Participation and Implementation Process

1. The NCC production team will reach out to you (either individually or through a group chat) to discuss the topic.
2. Once the topic is determined, the NCC team will establish an execution group (or convert the communication group into an execution group) to discuss further details related to the live broadcast and recording.
3. Within the execution group, the producers or hosts will work with you to create an outline, determine the duration of the live session, and confirm the scheduling of various time points.
4. NCC will provide a PowerPoint template, and you will need to create a presentation file based on the template for the live session.
5. You can demonstrate directly using an IDE during the live broadcast, but it is important to be well-prepared in advance to ensure the duration and effectiveness of the session.
6. The live session generally consists of the following stages:
    - Introduction of the guest by the host (optional: additional introduction by the producers)
    - Guest starts the presentation (the host hands over the screen and audio to the guest)
    - The host selects a few questions, prepared in advance or collected during the live session, to ask the guest
    - The host manages the flow and concludes the session
7. After the live broadcast, the guest will provide their presentation slides, sample code (which can be submitted to GitHub), and if available, a speech manuscript, to the host. These materials will be shared as additional resources in the NCC show notes for the community.
8. The producers or hosts will upload the recorded video to video-sharing websites and compile key timestamps, which will be updated in the show notes.
9. Finally, the guest speaker will be featured on the "Guests" page of the NCC website.
