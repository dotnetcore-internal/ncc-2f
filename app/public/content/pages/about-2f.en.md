# About Us

The _NCC Second Floor_ is a technical topic sharing column launched by TheNCC, which was founded at the end of 2023.


## The form of the Column


The _NCC Second Floor_ adopts the way of live streaming + recording. It periodically conducts online technical sharing sessions through live broadcasts, and after the live broadcast ends, the recorded videos are uploaded to video-sharing websites for more community members to watch.

At the same time, the _NCC Second Floor_ website will prepare show notes for each session, including:

- Time stamps and brief descriptions of the exciting presentations
- Presentation slides and sample code from the speakers
- Speech manuscripts from the speakers (if available)
- Other resources

## Topic Selection

The topics of _NCC Second Floor_ focus on "programming, programmers, .NET", including but not limited to:

* Topics related to the .NET technology stack, .NET Next, and the C# language.
* Discussions about new versions of .NET and C#.
* Events related to .NET, such as technical meetups, conferences, teaching sessions, and engaging group chats.
* Applications of .NET in various industries, particularly breakthroughs and advancements in emerging fields.
* Discussions about the work, life, career development planning, interviews, and social aspects of technical professionals.
